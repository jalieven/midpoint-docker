## Entitlements to roles

-   Map basic WebIDM role to LDAP
-   Split up the entitlements name to (meta) role
-   Assign the entitlement to the effective account via accountId
-   Map the organisation info in entitlement to Org structure (assignmentTargetSearch?)
-   Privileges in entitlement to effective role via mapping somewhere (dynamic and GUI editable)
-   Contact info stays on entitlement (find a way to map it to LDAP)
-   Map everything (orgs, roles, contactinfo) into LDAP structure
