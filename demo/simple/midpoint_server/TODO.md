## Entitlements to roles

-   Assign the entitlement to the effective account via accountId
-   Split up the entitlements name to (meta) role
-   Map the organisation info in entitlement to Org structure
-   Privileges in entitlement to effective role via mapping somewhere (dynamic)
-   Contact info stays on entitlement
-   Map everything (orgs, roles, contactinfo) into LDAP structure
